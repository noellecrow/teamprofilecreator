# Team Profile Generator

This project involved building a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each employee. Tests were written for each part of the code to ensure that it passes all of them in Jest.

When user is prompted to enter team members and their information, an HTML is generated that displays the team members based on employment title.
